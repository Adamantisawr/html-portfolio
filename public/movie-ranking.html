<h1> The best possible Anime list ever made according to Adam </h1>
<br/>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h3>
<p>By far the coolest depiction of retro futurism and has had huge influence on a lot of pop culture! Dark contrasting story, interesting characters and great sound design for it's time</p>
<h3>Re:Zero</h3>
<p>One of the most heartwrenching animes ever. Complicated but intriguing plot with incredible character development. It made me feel too many feels at times, even sick to my stomach but it's somehow in the best way possible.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>Has 2 of my favorite characters in anime history. Tanjiro and Tengen</p>
